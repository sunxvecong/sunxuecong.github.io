I’m a senior algorithm engineer at Huawei, working on speech-related algorithms and acoustic design for human-machine interaction. I have a bachelor’s degree in acoustics from Nanjing University and a doctoral degree in signal and information processing from Institute of Acoustics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interests include intelligent design and application of acoustic metamaterials. I’m passionate about creating innovative solutions for various scenarios by combining acoustic structures and intelligent algorithms, and exploring the potential of sound for various scenarios. I’m looking forward to connecting with you and sharing our ideas and experiences.
