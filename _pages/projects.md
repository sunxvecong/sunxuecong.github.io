Proximity Speech Interaction System Design
======
* An algorithm module was designed for close-to-mic speech detection, which can realize human-machine speech interaction without
wake-up phrases or button presses.
* This module can also be used to determine if the user is whispering, and if so, it will switch the voice assistant’s interaction mode to
whisper mode.

Speaker Localization for Vehicle’s System
======
* An algorithm module has been designed to detect the location of speakers within the car. When multiple speakers are present in the car, the module can determine the location of the user interacting with the voice assistant through the wake-up phrases, and then enhance the sound signal from that location.
