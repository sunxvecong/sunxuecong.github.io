Acoustic metamaterials are artificial composite acoustic structures, whose properties mainly depend on their geometric structures and arrangement. Therefore, acoustic metamaterials have many novel physical properties that natural materials do not have. In the past two decades, people have used acoustic metamaterials to realize a lot of novel physical phenomena, such as negative refraction and anisotropic materials. And many acoustic devices, including acoustic lens and cloaks, have been constructed based on acoustic metamaterials, which provided a new material platform for the manipulation of sound propagation. However, the development of accurate and computationally efficient design and optimization approaches for the acoustic metamaterials is still in the early stages. On the one hand, we need to design the complex acoustic structures efficiently and accurately to meet the requirements, that is, the intelligent design of acoustic metamaterials. On the other hand, we also need to consider the adaptability of the structures with the signal processing algorithm during the design process to optimize the performance of the whole acoustic system, that is, the intelligent application of acoustic metamaterials. This paper is devoted to explore the technical problems existing in the intelligent design and application of acoustic metamaterials. The main contents of this paper include following aspects:
