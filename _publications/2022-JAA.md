Abstract
======
Considering that the microstructure scale of metamaterials can not be ignored, the equivalent parameters of acoustic devices made by metamaterials are not continuous but discrete. In the process of design acoustic devices based on the metamaterials, it is necessary to layer the devices, and the selection of layering scheme often affects the working effect of the devices. In this paper, an optimization strategy used for layering the pentamode material cloak is proposed based on the genetic algorithm. The acoustic simulations of the cloak before and after optimization are carried out respectively, which shows that the scattered and reflected acoustic energy of the background acoustic field are greatly reduced after optimization for both narrowband and broadband detection signals. The proposed optimization strategy has a good performance, which can be extended to other types of metamaterial structure design.
