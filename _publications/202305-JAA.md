Abstract
======
In practical applications, it is necessary to combine several acoustic structures to realize broadband sound insulation in the low frequency range. Considering that the composite structures often have multiple parameters, it is difficult to design them efficiently using the traditional design methods. In this paper, we proposed a design method of the low-frequency broadband sound insulation device using deep learning model based on the lumped-parameter technique. Moreover, we designed a composite structure with 9 two-order Helmholtz resonators using the proposed method. The simulation results show that the composite structure has good sound insulation effect in the range of 158–522 Hz, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the traditional methods, the proposed method can not only reduce the dependency on the designer’s skills and experiences, but also improve design efficiency. The proposed model has a strong versatility and scalability, which can be further extended to other acoustic structures.
